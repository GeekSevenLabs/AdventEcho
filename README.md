# Advent Echo

Welcome to **Advent Echo**! This application is a digital platform designed to serve as a modern bulletin board for Adventist churches. It allows pastors, elders, deacons, and department leaders to share notices, schedules, and updates, ensuring the congregation stays connected and informed.

- Share schedules for singers, preachers, and other roles
- Post notices from church leadership
- Highlight departmental updates (e.g., music, youth, Sabbath School)
- Strengthen communication with a simple, accessible tool

## Features (Planned or Current)
- **Notices**: Create, edit, and delete notices with timestamps and details.
- **Schedules**: Manage rosters for church activities and roles.
- **Departments**: Organize content by church ministries (e.g., music, youth).
- **User Roles**: Permissions for pastors, elders, deacons, and members.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and phones.
