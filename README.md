# Advent Echo

Welcome to **Advent Echo**! This application is a digital platform designed to serve as a modern bulletin board for Adventist churches. It allows pastors, elders, deacons, and department leaders to share notices, schedules, and updates, ensuring the congregation stays connected and informed.

## Purpose

Advent Echo aims to bring the traditional church bulletin board into the digital age, creating a centralized space where the Adventist community can:
- Share schedules for singers, preachers, and other roles
- Post notices from church leadership
- Highlight departmental updates (e.g., music, youth, Sabbath School)
- Strengthen communication with a simple, accessible tool

## Features (Planned or Current)
